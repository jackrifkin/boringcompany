          <h2 class="largeTxt">WHY TUNNELS?</h2>
          <br>
          <p><b>Solve traffic: </b>to solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must be condensed to a single lane and moved underground, 
            where there is only one way in or out. Surface roads provide a superabundance of freedom, which is a problem that tunnels seek 
            to remedy by making your options only “stop” or “go” (but due to its popularity and high volumes of vehicles, it’s usually “stop”).
            <br><br>
            <b>Beautify our cities:</b> above ground transportation is overly practical. Tunnels, on the other hand, offer our engineers more fun 
            design challenges and provide a place for us to pour money. By moving public transportation underground, the volume of cars on the
            roads are reduced and the traffic is relocated beneath your feet. Out of sight, out of mind.
            <br><br>
            <b>Revolutionize public transportation: </b>tunnels allow cars to travel single file at high speeds, allowing passengers to enter the 
            vehicle and travel from point A to point B while only stopping sparingly, if at all, between destinations. Best of all, the 
            passengers don’t need to drive the vehicle itself. This concept is completely original and never-before-seen.

        <h2 class="largeTxt">THE BENEFITS OF TUNNELS</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Underground: </b>tunnels are underground. With the entry points generously spaced out from each other, entering the tunnel is an exercise in commitment - once you’re in, you’re in.
          <br><br>
          <b>Really Cool:</b> tunnels are really cool.
          <br><br>
          <b>Minimal Use of Land: </b>tunnels minimize the use of valuable surface land (see “Underground”). Tunnels also do not conflict with currently operating transportation systems, such as roads, sidewalks, or . . . nothing else comes to mind. 
          <br><br>
          <b>Minimal Surface Impact:</b> tunnel construction and operation are invisible, silent, and undetectable, making the inevitable underground traffic jams less of an eyesore and ensuring passengers won’t suffer from exposure to the sun or fresh air.
          <br><br>
          <b>Predetermined Stops: </b>The tunnel loop follows a regular schedule with known stops that can be mapped out beforehand and displayed in the designated loading and unloading stations. This innovative system allows you to better plan your trip and simplifies the notion of using a car as public transportation.
          <br><br>
          <b>Future Expansion: </b>it is much simpler to extend a tunnel-based system than a surface-based system. Simply open your checkbook and get digging.

          <h2 class="largeTxt">FUTURE EXPANSION</h2>
          <br>
          <p>
            Cities are in dire need of fast, efficient, affordable, eco-friendly travel. The Boring Company seeks to meet this need through the implementation of tunnel systems in every major city, providing people with an alternative to driving on the roads (by instead being driven along underground roads). Traffic* will be a thing of the past. The tunnel loop is a completely revolutionary solution to crowded city streets that has never before been attempted in any capacity.
            <br><br>
            This is the future of efficient city travel: <b>public transportation, personalized.</b>
